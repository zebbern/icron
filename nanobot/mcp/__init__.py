"""MCP (Model Context Protocol) client integration for nanobot.

This module enables nanobot to connect to MCP servers and use their tools.
MCP is an open protocol for connecting AI assistants to external data sources and tools.

Example:
    from nanobot.mcp import MCPClient

    client = MCPClient()
    await client.connect_to_server("filesystem", "/path/to/server.py")
    tools = await client.get_all_tools()
